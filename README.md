# Mechanical Failure Watchdog
##### Bearings Vibration Anomaly Detection

<hr />
<br />

Welcome to this Deep Learning project page&nbsp;!

Here, we develop an RNN model in order to detect early the forewarning signs
of forthcoming machinery hard failure.

The model we train is ready for deployment. Taking vibration sensor signal as input, it is able
to raise an alert, would the working conditions deteriorate to an extend that
the material is very likely to fail in a foreseeable future, thus indicating that
operation shall be stopped and replacement of the faulty part operated before
larger damage could be incured.

The below notebook contains an end-to-end ETL data pipeline plus a whole Bayesian Optimization cycle
for the LSTM Autoencoder implemented to fit the bill&nbsp;:
